# Creative Coding Quiz 8

## Imaging Technique Inspiration
I have been inspired to include the kaleidoscope imaging technique in my project. This technique can be seen in the following works:
- 'Honey (Lyric Video)' by Taylor Swift

- The opening credits of 'Dark', a German Netflix series created by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese

In my project, I will incorporate the use of clarity and distortion as in Taylor Swift's lyric video. Throughout the video, Taylor is very clear, while her surroundings are distorted into triangular and hexagonal shapes. Incorporating this would be beneficial as the project must be interactive. It would be interesting to explore how user interaction could lead to changing the intensity or shape of the artwork's distorted areas.

I will also incorporate Dark's layering of images with varying opacities while using the kaleidoscope technique. Abstracting the artwork by segmenting it, layering pieces of it together with different opacities, and then employing the kaleidoscope technique would satisfy the project criteria.

## Coding Technique Exploration
The below coding technique will help to achieve the desired effect for my project because it creates a kaleidoscope effect on an image and allows the angle and intensity of the distortion on the image to change through user interaction, specifically through cursor movement. The example code provided below uses for loops and rotations to create a mirror/reflection effect.

One version of the output of the code can be seen below:
